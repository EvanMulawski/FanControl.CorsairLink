1. Software mode only. Device lighting will be software-based.

2. The speed ramping in the Commander CORE and CORE XT is too slow for automatic sensor pairing and start/stop detection to function in Fan Control. Therefore, assisted setup will fail. Each control will need to be paired with its corresponding sensor manually and its start/stop values will need to be set manually.

3. Support is currently experimental and only available in a pre-release (see [Releases](https://github.com/EvanMulawski/FanControl.CorsairLink/releases)). Please provide your feedback in issues and discussions.

4. Variable pump speed using the device's Quiet, Balanced, and Performance presets based on the control's percent value:

   | Control % | Pump Mode   |
   | --------- | ----------- |
   | 0-33%     | Quiet       |
   | 34-67%    | Balanced    |
   | 68-100%   | Performance |

5. Reads the liquid temperature.

6. The USB device class is not HID and support cannot be added.

## Installation

⚠ This plugin will not function correctly if Corsair iCUE (specifically, the "Corsair Service" service) is running. This service should be stopped before running Fan Control. Running other programs that attempt to communicate with these devices while Fan Control is running is not currently a supported scenario.

⚠ This plugin requires the .NET Framework build of Fan Control. Install Fan Control using the `FanControl_net_4_8.zip` release files.

1. Download a [release](https://github.com/EvanMulawski/FanControl.CorsairLink/releases).
2. Unblock the downloaded ZIP file. (Right-click, Properties, check Unblock, OK)
3. Exit Fan Control.
4. Copy `FanControl.CorsairLink.dll` to the Fan Control `Plugins` directory.
5. Start Fan Control.

## Interoperability

This plugin implements a standard global mutex (`Global\CorsairLinkReadWriteGuardMutex`) to synchronize device communication.
